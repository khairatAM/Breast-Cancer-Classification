Topic: Breast Cancer Classification in Python

Description: This project classifies histology images as either being positive or negative samples of Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), a common type of breast cancer.

Dataset: 3GB of 50x50 breast cancer samples scanned at 40x with 198,738 IDC negative and 78,786 IDC positive. (Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images).

Key learning points:
1. Preprocessing image datasets from local directory via os, imutils and Keras packages in Python.
2. Image augmentation in Keras during training to improve model robustness.
3. Balancing the training loss of an unbalanced dataset using class weighting in Keras.
4. Familiar with CNNs but learned about Sperable Convolutions for faster and more efficient computation.
5. Improved proficiency with writing modules, classes, methods and file I/O in Python.
6. Handled overfitting of model by increasing kernel size and number of filters, and decreasing the learning rate.
